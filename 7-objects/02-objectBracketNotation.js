/*
     OBJECT BRACKET NOTATION

     - bracket notation can also be used with objects to pull out values, just like we wouuld with an array
     - object bracket notation can be handy if we want to store new keys in an object, and then reference those keys later on. 

     - all leys in an object are strings

The key name that we pass into the square brackets, needs to be wrapped in quotes, since all keys in objects are strings.
