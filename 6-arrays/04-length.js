// just like with strings, we can attach the length property to an array, and it will give us the length of the array. The length property doesn't start counting at 0 like when working with indices, it just simply counts how many items are present 

let long = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
console.log(long.length); // tells you how many items are in the array

CHALLENGE
************
    - First check if you are working with an array
    - Using a method, flip the values within the array (what was in index 4 is now in 0, 3 to 1, etc.)
    - Using a method, print the values of the newly arranged array
